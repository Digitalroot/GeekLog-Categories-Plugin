Install/Uninstall instruction for the Geeklog Games plugin.
<br><br>

INSTALL:
<br><br>

Step 1:  Back up your Geeklog Database.  The Games plugin adds tables to your Geeklog database.  You can do
this with the built in admin backup facility.
<br><br>

Step 2:  Uncompress the Games plugin archive while in the <geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will
create a directory called Games in the plugins directory.
<br><br>

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html directory (usually public_html)
create a directory called Games.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called Games.
<br><br>

Step 4:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/games/ directory.  Copy the files in the admin directory
to the admin/plugins/games/ directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the
public_html directory to the public_html/games/ directory your created in step 3.
<br><br>

Step 5:  Edit the config.php in the Games directory and confirm the table prefix and anonymous access
settings and other display settings.  The default is to use the geeklog table prefix and not allow
anonymous access.
<br><br>


Step 6:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and run install.php in your admin/plugins/games/ directory.
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not examine Geeklog system errorlog
for possible problems.
<br><br>


The Games plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the Games Icon will
take you to the admin page.
<br><br>

Step 7: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to Games administration and Viewing.
You can delegate control for either of these functions through the user and group editors.
<br><br>

UNINSTALL:
<br><br>
Step 1:  Run the install.php page in your admin/plugins/Games directory.  This will remove all the data from
your database.
<br><br>
Step 2:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/games/
<public_html>/games/ and <admin>/plugins/games/
<br><br>
Thats it.
