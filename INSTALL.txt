Install instruction for the Geeklog Categories plugin.

INSTALL.

Step 1:  Back up your Geeklog Database.  The Categories plugin adds tables to your Geeklog database.  You can do
this with the built in admin backup facility.

Step 2: Uncompress the Categories plugin archive. You should have the files below.

./INSTALL.txt

./plugins/categories/config.php
./plugins/categories/functions.inc
./plugins/categories/language/english.php
./plugins/categories/templates/admin.thtml
./plugins/categories/templates/blank.thtml
./plugins/categories/templates/index.thtml
./plugins/categories/templates/install.thtml

Copy the above "plugins" dir into the "<Geek Log Root>" dir.
There should already be a "plugins" dir there. It's ok to let
this one overwrite it. So "./plugins/categories/config.php"
becomes "<Geek Log Root>/plugins/categories/config.php" and so on.

./wwwroot/admin/plugins/categories/index.php
./wwwroot/admin/plugins/categories/install.html
./wwwroot/admin/plugins/categories/install.php

Next copy the above "admin" dir to your "./wwwroot/<Geek Log Html Root>/"
dir. The "wwwroot" dir is where your world readable files go. This
is sometimes called "htdocs", "wwwroot", "html", "www", "wwwhtml"
or "public_html" if you are unable to find it, ask you site admin.
There should already be an "admin" dir there. It's ok to let this one
overwrite it. So "./wwwroot/admin/plugins/categories/index.php"
becomes "./wwwroot/<Geek Log Html Root>/admin/plugins/categories/index.php"
and so on.

./wwwroot/categories/index.php
./wwwroot/categories/images/categories.gif
./wwwroot/categories/images/counterstrike.gif
./wwwroot/categories/images/ghostrecon.gif
./wwwroot/categories/images/halo.gif
./wwwroot/categories/images/hotline.gif
./wwwroot/categories/images/teamspeak.gif
./wwwroot/categories/images/ut.gif

Next copy the above "categories" dir to your "./wwwroot/<Geek Log Html Root>/"
dir. The "wwwroot" dir is where your world readable files go. This
is sometimes called "htdocs", "wwwroot", "html", "www", "wwwhtml"
or "public_html" if you are unable to find it, ask you site admin.
So "./wwwroot/categories/index.php" becomes
"./wwwroot/<Geek Log Html Root>/categories/index.php" and so on.
